## Overview

Welcome to the **Network Traffic Analysis and Attack Detection** repository! This project focuses on identifying and documenting malicious network activity using packet capture (PCAP) files and Wireshark. By analyzing network traffic, this project aims to detect various types of attacks such as bruteforce, data exfiltration, denial-of-service (DoS), and unauthorized access.
